/* PDF transparency groups can be isolated or non-isolated. This test
 * checks that the PDF output is using isolated groups. If the group
 * is non-isolated the bottom half of the inner rectangle will be
 * red. Note poppler-cairo currently ignores the isolated flag and
 * treats the group as isolated.

 * Refer to http://www.pdfvt.com/PDFVT_TransparencyGuide.html for an
 * explanation isolated vs non-isolated.
