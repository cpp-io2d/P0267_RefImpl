Changes since the last public release (1.6.7):

Version 1.6.8beta01 [December 1, 2013]
  Changed #ifdef PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED in pngpread.c to
    #ifdef PNG_SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED to be consistent with
    what is in pngpriv.h.
  Moved prototype for png_handle_unknown() in pngpriv.h outside of
    the #ifdef PNG_SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED/#endif block.
  Added "-Wall" to CFLAGS in contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Conditionally compile some unused functions reported by -Wall in pngminim.
  Fixed 'minimal' builds. Various obviously useful minimal configurations
    don't build because of missing contrib/libtests test programs and
    overly complex dependencies in scripts/pnglibconf.dfa. This change
    adds contrib/conftest/*.dfa files that can be used in automatic build
    scripts to ensure that these configurations continue to build.
  Enabled WRITE_INVERT and WRITE_PACK in contrib/pngminim/encoder.
  Fixed pngvalid 'fail' function declaration on the Intel C Compiler.
    This reverts to the previous 'static' implementation and works round
    the 'unused static function' warning by using PNG_UNUSED().

Version 1.6.8beta02 [November 30, 2013]
  Removed or marked PNG_UNUSED some harmless "dead assignments" reported
    by clang scan-build.
  Changed tabs to 3 spaces in png_debug macros and changed '"%s"m'
    to '"%s" m' to improve portability among compilers.
  Changed png_free_default() to free() in pngtest.c

Version 1.6.8beta03 [December 1, 2013]
  Tidied up pngfix inits and fixed pngtest no-write builds.
