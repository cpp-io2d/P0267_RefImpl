/* This tries to trigger a bug in the xcb backend where a Picture is freed to
 * early. It goes something like this:
 *
 * - _composite_mask calls _cairo_xcb_picture_for_pattern to get a xcb_picture_t
 *   for the source.
 * - _cairo_xcb_picture_for_pattern calls _cairo_xcb_surface_picture which calls
 *   _cairo_xcb_screen_store_surface_picture which adds the picture to a cache.
 * - _cairo_xcb_surface_picture also attached the picture as a snapshot to
 *   the source surface using cairo_surface_finish as detach_func.
 * - _composite_mask calls _cairo_xcb_picture_for_pattern to get a xcb_picture_t
 *   for the mask.
 * - The resulting picture surface is added to the cache again, but the cache is
 *   already full, so a random cache entry is picked and removed.
 * - The surface that was added before is picked and gets fed to
 *   _surface_cache_entry_destroy.
 * - This calls _cairo_surface_detach_snapshot which causes the
 *   detach_func from above to be called, so the surface is finished and the
 *   associated picture is FreePicture'd.
 * - _composite_mask now uses a Picture that was already freed.
 *
 * So this depends on the screen's surface cache to be full which is why we do
 * all this looping.
