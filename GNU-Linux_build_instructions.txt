You will need a relatively recent build of GNU autotools. Any recent distro
should have a reasonably new version available which will fit the needs here.
You will also need cairo, GTK+3, and related libraries; as long as you have
autotools, if you should be able to generate a configure script and it will
tell you if you are missing any other dependencies.

To build the project, from this directory run the command 'autoreconf -i'. It
should run for a bit then complete silently. If so, you should then run the
generated './configure' script with any necessary parameters. This should
notify you if you are missing any pre-requisites or have an older version that
won't work. If configure completes successfully, you should be able to run the
'make' command and then execute the resulting executable by calling
the './N3888_RefImpl/src/N3888_RefImpl' executable.

The drawing portion is the same code as in the Windows version. The entry
point uses GTK+3 and is primarily C code. It is patterned after Gnome project
utilities. It has improved significantly and is now essentially on par with
the Windows version.

Tested on OpenSUSE 13.2 with GCC 4.9.0 using the following configure command:
'./configure CC=gcc-4.9 CXX=g++-4.9 CXXFLAGS="-g -std=c++1y"'. Also tested
with Clang 3.5 using the configure settings found in the
run-configure-with-clang-and-libstdc++.sh shell script.
